Certainly! We'll create a simple clock face to demonstrate the concept of time in a graphical form. We'll use C#'s `System.Windows.Media` namespace to draw the clock hands on it, pointing at a random time to make it simple for a beginner to understand.

Here's an example of a C# class that would draw a static clock with randomly set hands:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class ClockDrawer
{
    private Random _random;
    private double _radius;
    private Point _center;

    public ClockDrawer()
    {
        _random = new Random();
        _radius = 100; // radius of the clock
        _center = new Point(_radius, _radius); // center of the clock
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Draw clock face
        context.DrawEllipse(null, new Pen(Brushes.Black, 2), _center, _radius, _radius);

        // Get random time
        int hour = _random.Next(1, 13);
        int minute = _random.Next(0, 60);

        // Draw hour hand
        DrawHand(context, hour * 30 - 90, _radius / 2, 6, Brushes.Blue);

        // Draw minute hand
        DrawHand(context, minute * 6 - 90, _radius * 0.8, 4, Brushes.Green);
    }

    private void DrawHand(DrawingContext context, double angle, double length, double thickness, Brush color)
    {
        // Calculate the hand endpoint based on angle
        double radian = Math.PI / 180 * angle;
        Point endPoint = new Point(
            _center.X + length * Math.Cos(radian),
            _center.Y + length * Math.Sin(radian)
        );
        
        // Draw the line representing the clock hand
        context.DrawLine(new Pen(color, thickness), _center, endPoint);
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- We create a `ClockDrawer` class with a constructor that initializes our drawing parameters: a random number generator, the radius of the clock, and its center point.
- The `Draw` method is responsible for rendering the clock.
- We draw the clock face using `DrawEllipse`.
- We generate a random hour between 1 and 12 and a random minute between 0 and 59.
- We calculate the angles for the hour and minute hands and draw them with `DrawHand`, a separate method that takes in the necessary parameters to draw a line from the center of the clock to a calculated endpoint based on the angle and length provided.
- The `-90` in the angle calculation is there to adjust the hand's start position from 3 o'clock to 12 o'clock.

You can compile and execute this code to view the static random time on the clock. Remember, this is a simple static representation not a real-time clock.
