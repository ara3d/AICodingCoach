Certainly! Here is a simple C# class that explains and demonstrates the `Size` type using a visual example. The `Size` type represents the width and height of a rectangular region.

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class SizeExample
{
    public SizeExample()
    {
        // Parameterless constructor
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // First, we define a Size with a specific width and height.
        Size rectangleSize = new Size(200, 100);

        // Describe the rectangle using the Size
        Rect rectangle = new Rect(new Point(50, 50), rectangleSize);

        // Create a SolidColorBrush for the rectangle's color
        SolidColorBrush brush = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Coral);

        // Finally, let's draw the rectangle on the canvas using the DrawingContext.
        context.DrawRectangle(brush, null, rectangle);

        // Let's add a border so it's clearer
        Pen pen = new Pen(new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Black), 2);
        context.DrawRectangle(null, pen, rectangle);

        // We could also use the Size to draw other shapes. For instance,
        // we can draw an ellipse inside the same rectangle to demonstrate the use of Size.
        context.DrawEllipse(null, pen, new Point(rectangle.X + rectangleSize.Width / 2,
                                                 rectangle.Y + rectangleSize.Height / 2),
                            rectangleSize.Width / 2, rectangleSize.Height / 2);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- We have a `SizeExample` class with a parameterless constructor.
- The `Draw` method accepts a `DrawingContext` from WPF, which is used to render graphics.
- We create a `Size` object named `rectangleSize`, which holds a `Width` of 200 and a `Height` of 100.
- A `Rect` object, `rectangle`, is constructed with the top-left corner at a point (50, 50) and with the size `rectangleSize`.
- We use a `SolidColorBrush` to fill the rectangle and a `Pen` for the border.
- The `DrawRectangle` method of `DrawingContext` is used to draw a filled and outlined rectangle.
- We also draw an ellipse using the same `Size` as the radius for width and height to show how `Size` can be used for various shapes.

When this code is executed within a WPF application context, it will draw two shapes on the screen: a coral-colored rectangle with a black border and an ellipse outlined in black to visually demonstrate the `Size` type.
