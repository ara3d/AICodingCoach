Certainly! Linear interpolation is a simple method of estimating a value that lies between two known values. In the context of graphics, we can interpolate between colors, positions, or sizes. In this example, I will demonstrate linear interpolation between two colors in a horizontal gradient.

Hereâ€™s a simple class with a `Draw` method to illustrate linear interpolation:

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class LinearInterpolationExample
{
    public LinearInterpolationExample()
    {
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Define the start and end points of the interpolation.
        Point startPoint = new Point(100, 100);
        Point endPoint = new Point(400, 100);
        
        // Define the start and end colors for interpolation.
        Color startColor = Colors.Blue;
        Color endColor = Colors.Red;

        // Draw line to indicate the interpolation space.
        context.DrawLine(new Pen(Brushes.Black, 1), startPoint, endPoint);

        // Loop from the start to the end point, drawing small rectangles with interpolated colors.
        for (double i = 0; i <= 1; i += 0.01)
        {
            // Linear interpolation formula for colors: (1-t)*startColor + t*endColor
            Color interpolatedColor = Color.FromArgb(
                (byte)((1 - i) * startColor.A + i * endColor.A),
                (byte)((1 - i) * startColor.R + i * endColor.R),
                (byte)((1 - i) * startColor.G + i * endColor.G),
                (byte)((1 - i) * startColor.B + i * endColor.B)
            );

            // Create a solid color brush with the interpolated color.
            Brush brush = new SolidColorBrush(interpolatedColor);

            // Calculate the position based on the interpolation factor.
            Point interpolatedPoint = new Point(
                startPoint.X + i * (endPoint.X - startPoint.X), 
                startPoint.Y
            );
            
            // Draw a small rectangle at the interpolated position.
            context.DrawRectangle(brush, null, new Rect(interpolatedPoint, new Size(4, 20)));
        }
    }
}
```

In this code example, we create a gradient from blue to red. The `Draw` method uses a loop to interpolate between the blue and red colors along the line defined by `startPoint` and `endPoint`. The loop uses a step factor `i` that represents the interpolation factor and changes from 0 to 1, where 0 is the start color and 1 is the end color.

For every step, we calculate the interpolated color and draw a small rectangle with that color, creating a smooth gradient effect. The visualization of this linear interpolation allows the newcomer to understand how the transition between two values can be achieved smoothly by incrementally mixing their properties.
