Certainly! Here's a simple visual C# code example that uses a `while` loop to draw a series of concentric circles, which demonstrates the use of iteration (looping) to repeat drawing operations. In programming, a `while` loop will continue to execute as long as its condition remains true.

```csharp
using System.Windows.Media;

public class ConcentricCircles
{
    // Parameterless constructor
    public ConcentricCircles()
    {
    }

    // The Draw method that accepts a DrawingContext to draw graphics
    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        // We will define radial distance between circles and their color
        double radius = 10;
        double increment = 10;
        SolidColorBrush circleBrush = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.DeepSkyBlue);

        // Set the center of the circles to the middle of the drawing area
        Point center = new Point(200, 200);

        // Start the while loop
        while (radius <= 200)
        {
            // Draw a circle with the current radius
            drawingContext.DrawEllipse(circleBrush, null, center, radius, radius);

            // Increment the radius for the next circle
            radius += increment;
        }

        // The while loop above will repeat drawing larger and larger circles
        // until the radius is greater than 200 units
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- We start with a `radius` of 10 and a specified `increment` of 10 units.
- The `while` loop checks if `radius` is less than or equal to 200; if it is, it enters the loop.
- Inside the loop, we use `drawingContext.DrawEllipse` to draw a circle at the `center` point with the current `radius`.
- After drawing each circle, we increase the `radius` by the `increment` value.
- The loop will continue to run, drawing larger circles until the `radius` is greater than 200, at which point the loop stops.

This example visually demonstrates the principle of looping: performing a repetitive task (drawing circles) while a condition is met (radius is not too large).
