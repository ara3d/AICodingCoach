Certainly! Let's create a visual example using an `if` statement to draw two different shapes based on a random condition. We'll draw a red circle if a randomly chosen number is even, and a blue square if it's odd. This will help you understand how `if` statements work to control the flow of a program based on conditions.

Here's a simple C# class demonstrating this:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class ConditionalShapesDrawer
{
    private Random random;
    private SolidColorBrush redBrush;
    private SolidColorBrush blueBrush;
    private Pen outlinePen;

    public ConditionalShapesDrawer()
    {
        // Initialize random number generator, brushes, and pen.
        this.random = new Random();
        this.redBrush = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromRgb(255, 0, 0));
        this.blueBrush = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromRgb(0, 0, 255));
        this.outlinePen = new Pen(Brushes.Black, 2);
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        // Generate a random number between 0 and 99.
        int number = this.random.Next(100);

        // Set the position and size for our shapes.
        Rect shapeRect = new Rect(50, 50, 100, 100);
        
        // Check if the number is even using the mod operator (%)
        if (number % 2 == 0)
        {
            // The number is even: draw a red circle.
            drawingContext.DrawEllipse(this.redBrush, this.outlinePen, new Point(100, 100), 50, 50);
        }
        else
        {
            // The number is odd: draw a blue square.
            drawingContext.DrawRectangle(this.blueBrush, this.outlinePen, shapeRect);
        }
        
        // Let's also draw the number on the screen, so we know what we got!
        var formattedText = new FormattedText(
            number.ToString(),
            System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,
            FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
            new Typeface("Verdana"),
            32,
            Brushes.Black
        );
        
        drawingContext.DrawText(formattedText, new Point(160, 20));
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- We use a `Random` object to generate a random number.
- Based on whether the number is even or odd (`number % 2 == 0`), we instruct the `DrawingContext` to draw either a red circle or a blue square.
- The `%` operator is the modulus operator, which calculates the remainder of a division. If the remainder is zero when dividing by 2, the number is even.
- We also display the random number itself on the screen, so viewers can see the actual value that's determining the shape being drawn.

Every time this code runs, it generates a new random number and, depending on whether it's even or odd, you'll see a red circle or a blue square on the screen. It's a simple yet effective way to learn what an `if` statement can do!
