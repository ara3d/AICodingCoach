Certainly! In programming, a constant is a value that doesn't change once defined. In C#, we use the `const` keyword to define such a value. Below is a simple class that defines a constant to represent the radius of a circle and then draws that circle using the constant value.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class ConstantCircleDrawer
{
    // Define a constant for the radius of the circle we'll draw.
    private const double CircleRadius = 50.0;

    public ConstantCircleDrawer()
    {
        // Parameterless constructor
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        // Create a SolidColorBrush with a blue color to fill the circle.
        SolidColorBrush brush = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromRgb(0, 0, 255));
        
        // Define the center point of our circle. We're using constants here as well.
        const double centerX = 150;
        const double centerY = 150;

        // Draw the circle using the defined constant values for the radius and center.
        drawingContext.DrawEllipse(brush, null, new Point(centerX, centerY), CircleRadius, CircleRadius);

        // Let's also add a simple text label to clarify what's happening
        FormattedText text = new FormattedText(
            $"Circle radius is a constant: {CircleRadius}",
            System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
            FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
            new Typeface("Verdana"),
            20,
            Brushes.Black
        );

        drawingContext.DrawText(text, new Point(centerX - CircleRadius, centerY + CircleRadius + 10));
    }
}
```

In this example, the constant `CircleRadius` is used within the `Draw` method to draw a circle of a fixed size each time, demonstrating the immutability of constants. The circle is filled with a blue solid color, and a text label is added below the circle to note that the radius is a constant.
