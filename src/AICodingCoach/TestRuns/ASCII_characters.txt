Certainly! In this C# code sample, I'm going to create a simple class named `ASCIIDemo`. This class will have a method called `Draw` that will output some ASCII characters as graphics. We'll use the `DrawingContext` to draw text on the screen, effectively showing how ASCII characters are simply symbols that can be represented graphically. Here's how we can do it:

```csharp
using System.Windows.Media;
using System.Windows;

public class ASCIIDemo
{
    public ASCIIDemo() {}

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Define a Typeface to specify the font family, weight, and style
        Typeface typeface = new Typeface("Consolas");

        // Start position for the first character
        Point startPos = new Point(10, 10);

        // Size of the font
        double fontSize = 20;

        // Use a SolidColorBrush for the text color
        SolidColorBrush brush = new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromRgb(0, 0, 0));

        for (int i = 33; i <= 126; i++) // Looping through a selection of ASCII character codes
        {
            var formChar = (char)i;  // Convert ASCII code to character
            var formattedText = new FormattedText(
                formChar.ToString(),
                System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
                FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
                typeface,
                fontSize,
                brush,
                VisualTreeHelper.GetDpi(context.VisualTarget).PixelsPerDip
            );

            // Draw the character
            context.DrawText(formattedText, startPos);

            // Update position for next character
            startPos.X += 20;

            // Wrap line every 10 characters
            if ((i - 32) % 10 == 0)
            {
                startPos.X = 10;
                startPos.Y += 30; // Move to the next line
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this class:

1. The `Draw` method takes a `DrawingContext` as input. This is used to render graphics.
2. A `Typeface` is created using the "Consolas" font family, which is a monospaced font often used for displaying code and ASCII art.
3. The `for` loop iterates over a range of ASCII codes from 33 (the first printable character) to 126 (the tilde `~`).
4. Each ASCII code is converted to its character representation using the `(char)i` cast.
5. `FormattedText` is created for each character, which is then drawn on the screen with `context.DrawText`.
6. The position is updated for subsequent characters, and we wrap to the next line after every 10 characters.

This is a visual demonstration of ASCII characters, giving a learner insight into how text and characters we use in programming are represented and can be drawn as graphics.
