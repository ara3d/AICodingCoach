This code sample introduces a beginner to the concept of computing an average using graphics. We will use circles with varying diameters to represent individual values and then show the average by calculating and drawing a circle that represents the average diameter.

Here's a C# class that demonstrates this concept:

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class AverageVisualizer
{
    private double[] values;
    
    public AverageVisualizer()
    {
        // Initialize with some example values
        values = new double[] { 50, 70, 90, 60, 80 };
    }
    
    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        if (drawingContext == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(drawingContext));
        
        // Calculate the average
        double sum = 0;
        foreach (double value in values)
        {
            sum += value;
        }
        double average = sum / values.Length;
        
        // Set up drawing parameters
        Brush brush = Brushes.Blue;
        Pen pen = new Pen(Brushes.Black, 2);
        
        // Draw the individual circles representing the values
        double x = 10; // starting x position
        double y = 100; // fixed y position for all circles
        foreach (double value in values)
        {
            drawingContext.DrawEllipse(brush, pen, new Point(x, y), value / 2, value / 2);
            x += value + 10; // move to the right for the next circle
        }
        
        // Draw the average circle in a different color
        Brush averageBrush = Brushes.Red;
        x += 20; // Add some space before drawing the average circle
        // Draw the average circle
        drawingContext.DrawEllipse(averageBrush, pen, new Point(x, y), average / 2, average / 2);
        
        // Optionally you can add text to indicate average
        FormattedText formattedText = new FormattedText(
            "Average",
            System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,
            FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
            new Typeface("Verdana"),
            12,
            Brushes.Black);

        drawingContext.DrawText(formattedText, new Point(x - (formattedText.Width / 2), y - average / 2 - 20));
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- We've created a class `AverageVisualizer`, which contains an array of `double` numbers, representing some values we'll compute the average for.
- The `Draw` method first checks if `drawingContext` is not null.
- It calculates the average by adding up all the numbers (`sum`) and then dividing by the count of numbers (`values.Length`).
- Individual circles are drawn for each value in the array, at a fixed `y` position but varying `x` positions. The radius of each circle is half the value it represents.
- After drawing all the individual circles, we draw one final circle in red, which represents the average. Its radius is half the computed average (`average / 2`).
- Additionally, we add text to label the average circle with the word "Average".
  
When compiled and run in a WPF application, this code will visually demonstrate the concept of average with circles of varying diameters along with a special circle that represents their average. Learners can see the relationship between individual values and their average in a graphical form, which is helpful for visual learners.
