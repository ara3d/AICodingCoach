Here's a simple C# code example that demonstrates the concept of objects and polymorphism through a visual representation. In this example, we create a `Shape` class, which serves as a base class, and two derived classes, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, that override the base class's `Draw` method. When we run the program, we draw both a circle and a rectangle on the canvas, showing how different objects can be treated uniformly through a base class type.

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

// Base class representing a generic shape
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract void Draw(DrawingContext context);
}

// A Circle is a kind of Shape
public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Set the circle properties
        var center = new Point(150, 150);
        double radius = 100;
        var pen = new Pen(Brushes.Blue, 2);
        var brush = Brushes.SkyBlue;

        // Draw the circle using DrawingContext
        context.DrawEllipse(brush, pen, center, radius, radius);
    }
}

// A Rectangle is a kind of Shape
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Set the rectangle properties
        var topLeft = new Point(300, 100);
        var size = new Size(200, 150);
        var pen = new Pen(Brushes.Green, 2);
        var brush = Brushes.LightGreen;

        // Draw the rectangle using DrawingContext
        context.DrawRectangle(brush, pen, new Rect(topLeft, size));
    }
}

// Renderer class that accepts DrawingContext and draws shapes
public class ShapeRenderer
{
    public Shape Shape { get; set; }

    public ShapeRenderer(Shape shape)
    {
        Shape = shape;
    }

    public void Render(DrawingContext context)
    {
        Shape.Draw(context);
    }
}

public class GraphicalExample
{
    public GraphicalExample()
    {
        // Parameterless constructor (required)
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Create a Circle and a Rectangle, both as Shape references
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();

        // Draw the shapes using polymorphism
        circle.Draw(context); // Draws a circle
        rectangle.Draw(context); // Draws a rectangle
    }
}
```

This code sample shows how polymorphism allows us to interact with objects of different types (Circle and Rectangle) in a unified way through their common base type (Shape). The `Draw` methods within the Circle and Rectangle classes provide their own specific implementations, and when we call these methods on the Shape references, the corresponding shapes are drawn on the screen.

This is a simplified introduction to object-oriented programming concepts, and a good starting point for beginners to understand how to create object hierarchies and use polymorphism in C#.
