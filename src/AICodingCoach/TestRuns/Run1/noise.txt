Creating visual noise in C# using WPF can be quite fun! Noise is often used in graphics programming to create textures, to simulate randomness or to give a natural appearance to graphics. We can create a simple noise pattern using C# by drawing random pixels on a canvas. Below is a simple and playful C# class with a `Draw` function that generates noise.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Media;
using System.Windows;

public class NoiseVisualizer
{
    // Parameterless constructor
    public NoiseVisualizer() { }

    // This method will draw random noise onto the screen.
    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Define the dimensions of the noise area
        int width = 200;
        int height = 200;

        // Create a Random object to generate random numbers
        Random random = new Random();

        // Loop through each pixel in the specified area
        for (int x = 0; x < width; x++)
        {
            for (int y = 0; y < height; y++)
            {
                // Generate a random grayscale color
                byte grayScale = (byte)random.Next(256);
                Color randomColor = Color.FromRgb(grayScale, grayScale, grayScale);

                // Create a brush with the random color
                Brush brush = new SolidColorBrush(randomColor);

                // Draw a single pixel (actually a very small rectangle)
                context.DrawRectangle(brush, null, new Rect(x, y, 1, 1));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `NoiseVisualizer` class has a `Draw` method that receives a `DrawingContext` object, which is a WPF drawing surface. Inside the `Draw` method, we loop through each pixel position in a predefined area (200x200 in this example) and draw a tiny rectangle of size 1x1 pixels with a random grayscale color, thus creating noise visually.

The `Random` class from the System namespace is used to generate the random numbers for the grayscale value. Inside the loop, we create a new `Color` structure and a `SolidColorBrush` with this color to draw each pixel.

When this code runs, a 200x200 area filled with random grayscale noise will be displayed, providing a visual representation of noise on screen.
