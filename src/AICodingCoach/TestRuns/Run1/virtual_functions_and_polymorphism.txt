Certainly! Below is a simple C# code example that demonstrates the concept of virtual functions and polymorphism. We'll create a base class called `Shape` with a virtual method `Draw`, which will be overridden by two derived classes, `Circle` and `Square`. When we call the `Draw` method on a list of `Shape` objects, polymorphism lets us invoke the appropriate method depending on the actual type of the object, despite the reference being of type `Shape`.

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

// Base class representing a generic shape
public class Shape
{
    public virtual void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Default drawing logic for a shape (e.g. a placeholder message)
        FormattedText text = new FormattedText("Undefined Shape",
            System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
            FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
            new Typeface("Arial"),
            12, Brushes.Black, new NumberSubstitution(),
            TextFormattingMode.Display);

        context.DrawText(text, new Point(10, 10));
    }
}

// Derived class representing a circle
public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Draw a simple circle
        context.DrawEllipse(Brushes.SkyBlue, new Pen(Brushes.Black, 2), new Point(100, 100), 50, 50);
    }
}

// Derived class representing a square
public class Square : Shape
{
    public override void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Draw a simple square
        context.DrawRectangle(Brushes.LightGreen, new Pen(Brushes.Black, 2), new Rect(50, 50, 100, 100));
    }
}

// Main class containing the Draw logic
public class PolymorphicShapes
{
    private Shape[] shapes;

    public PolymorphicShapes()
    {
        // Initialize shape array with different shape types
        shapes = new Shape[]
        {
            new Circle(),
            new Square(),
            new Shape() // Undefined shape, will use base class' Draw
        };
    }

    // Draw all shapes using polymorphism
    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        foreach (Shape shape in shapes)
        {
            shape.Draw(context);
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. We have a base class `Shape` with a virtual method `Draw`. This method can be overridden by derived classes to provide specific drawing behaviors.
2. The `Circle` class overrides `Draw` to draw a circle with `DrawingContext.DrawEllipse`.
3. The `Square` class overrides `Draw` to draw a square with `DrawingContext.DrawRectangle`.
4. In `PolymorphicShapes`, we create an array of `Shape` objects, which include instances of `Circle`, `Square`, and the base `Shape` itself.
5. When we loop over this array and call `Draw` on each element, the runtime determines the actual type of the object and invokes the appropriate `Draw` method. This is polymorphism in action.

To see this working, instantiate the `PolymorphicShapes` class and call its `Draw` method:

```csharp
PolymorphicShapes shapesDrawer = new PolymorphicShapes();
shapesDrawer.Draw(yourDrawingContext);
```

Remember, the actual drawing will be handled by the framework, which calls your `Draw` method with the provided `DrawingContext`.
