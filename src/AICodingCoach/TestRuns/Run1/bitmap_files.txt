Certainly! To work with bitmap files in C#, we can use the `BitmapImage` class from the `System.Windows.Media.Imaging` namespace to load an image and then draw it on a canvas provided by the `DrawingContext`. For this example, I'll simplify the process since it's for someone new to programming.

We'll need a couple of things first:
- A bitmap image file to use (for this example, let's assume we have a file named "example.bmp" in the same directory as the executable)
- An understanding of how to create a `BitmapImage` and draw it

Below is a C# code example that illustrates how to load and draw a bitmap image.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;
using System.Windows.Media.Imaging;

public class BitmapExample
{
    public BitmapExample()
    {
        // Parameterless constructor. Setup could be done here if needed.
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        // Load the bitmap image.
        BitmapImage bitmap = new BitmapImage(new Uri("example.bmp", UriKind.Relative));
        
        // Create a rectangle the size of the bitmap image.
        Rect imageRect = new Rect(0, 0, bitmap.PixelWidth, bitmap.PixelHeight);

        // Draw the image within the specified rectangle.
        drawingContext.DrawImage(bitmap, imageRect);

        // For demonstration, let's also draw a border around the image.
        Pen borderPen = new Pen(Brushes.Red, 2);  // A red border with a thickness of 2
        drawingContext.DrawRectangle(null, borderPen, imageRect); // No fill, just the border
    }
}
```

Here's what is happening in the `Draw` method:
1. We create a new `BitmapImage` object by giving it a URI that points to "example.bmp".
2. We create a `Rect` structure that represents the area where we want to draw the image. We use the image's dimensions to define the rectangle size.
3. We use `DrawImage` from `DrawingContext` to draw the bitmap within the rectangle.
4. An extra step adds a simple red border around the image using `DrawRectangle`.

Remember to place the "example.bmp" image in the same directory as your application, otherwise, you would need to provide the correct path to locate the image.

Keep in mind that for larger projects or different image formats, you might need to employ different loading strategies and consider the `Image` control provided by WPF for image handling on user interfaces.
