Certainly! Lambdas in C# are a succinct way to write anonymous methods; they're often used with LINQ or for event handling. In graphics, we can use them to apply a function that changes properties of shapes, like their colors. Here's a simple example that will draw a series of rectangles, each with a different color using a lambda to vary the color based on the rectangle's position.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class ColorfulRectangles
{
    public ColorfulRectangles()
    {
        // Constructor isn't used in this example, but it's required for the class.
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Define the size and number of rectangles.
        int numberOfRectangles = 10;
        Size rectSize = new Size(50, 50);

        // Lambda to calculate a color based on the rectangle index.
        Func<int, Color> getColor = index =>
        {
            byte red = (byte)(255 * (index / (float)numberOfRectangles));
            byte green = (byte)(255 - red);
            byte blue = 50; // Constant blue for simplicity
            return Color.FromRgb(red, green, blue);
        };

        // Draw the rectangles with varying colors.
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfRectangles; i++)
        {
            // Use the lambda to get the color.
            Color rectColor = getColor(i);
            Brush rectBrush = new SolidColorBrush(rectColor);

            // Set the position and draw the rectangle.
            double x = i * rectSize.Width;
            double y = 0;
            Rect rect = new Rect(x, y, rectSize.Width, rectSize.Height);
            context.DrawRectangle(rectBrush, null, rect);
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
1. This class `ColorfulRectangles` has a `Draw` method that accepts a `DrawingContext` as an argument.
2. Inside the `Draw` method, we define a lambda expression `getColor` which takes an `int` (`index`) and returns a `Color`. It calculates a gradient effect by adjusting the red and green channels.
3. A loop is used to draw a series of rectangles where the color of each rectangle is determined by passing the loop index to the lambda expression.
4. The `DrawingContext` `context` is used to draw the rectangles at the calculated positions, with the colors determined by the lambda expression.

When the `Draw` method is called, it will produce a series of colored rectangles across the screen with a gradual change in color, demonstrating how a lambda can encapsulate a simple color transformation algorithm.
