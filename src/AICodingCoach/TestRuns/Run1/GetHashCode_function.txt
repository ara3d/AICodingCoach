Certainly! Let's create a visual example that demonstrates the `GetHashCode` function in C#. The `GetHashCode` function is primarily used to generate a unique identifier for objects, which is typically used in hashing algorithms and data structures like hash tables.

In our example, we'll create a class called `HashCodeVisualizer`. This class will draw rectangles on the screen, each representing an object with its hash code displayed within it. Different colors will represent different hash codes to visually differentiate them.

Here's the C# class with explanations:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class HashCodeVisualizer
{
    // This is the parameterless constructor required by the instruction.
    public HashCodeVisualizer()
    {
        // Constructor logic can be added here if needed.
    }

    // The Draw method takes a DrawingContext used to draw our graphics.
    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        // Create an array of example objects (in this case, strings).
        string[] objectsToHash = { "apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple" };

        // Define some drawing settings, like the width and height of the rectangles.
        double rectWidth = 100;
        double rectHeight = 50;
        double spacing = 20;  // Spacing between rectangles.

        // starting x and y positions for drawing
        double x = spacing; 
        double y = spacing;

        // Draw each object and its hash code
        foreach (string obj in objectsToHash)
        {
            // Get the hash code of the current object.
            int hashCode = obj.GetHashCode();
            // Convert the hash code to a color (just using the lower 24 bits to create a color).
            Color color = Color.FromRgb((byte)(hashCode >> 16), (byte)(hashCode >> 8), (byte)hashCode);
            Brush brush = new SolidColorBrush(color);

            // Create a rectangle filled with the color associated with the hash code.
            drawingContext.DrawRectangle(brush, null, new Rect(x, y, rectWidth, rectHeight));

            // Display the string and its hash code within the rectangle.
            FormattedText text = new FormattedText(
                $"{obj} - {hashCode}",
                System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
                FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
                new Typeface("Verdana"),
                14,
                Brushes.Black);

            drawingContext.DrawText(text, new Point(x + 5, y + (rectHeight/2) - (text.Height/2)));

            // Move down to the next drawing position.
            y += rectHeight + spacing;
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation of the code:

1. We define a class `HashCodeVisualizer` with a parameterless constructor.
2. In the `Draw` method, we prepare a list of objects (strings in this case) to hash.
3. For each object, we calculate its hash code using the `GetHashCode` function. This hash code is then used to generate a color, which visually represents the hash code.
4. We create a rectangle colored based on the hash code, and draw the object's string and hash code within that rectangle.
5. We repeat this process, drawing a series of rectangles with associated hash codes for each object. This provides a visual representation of how hash codes can be used to uniquely identify objects, even if two objects have the same string value (e.g., "apple").

When you run this code, you'll see that identical objects (two "apple"s in the sample) have the same color because they have identical hash codes, while different objects have different colors representing different hash codes. This process would simulate how objects might be stored in a hash table.
