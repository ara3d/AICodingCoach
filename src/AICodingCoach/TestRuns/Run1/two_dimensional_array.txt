Certainly! Let's create a C# class that visually represents a two dimensional array as a grid of colored squares on the canvas. Each square's color will be randomly determined to make it more fun. This example will help a newcomer understand how to define a two dimensional array and iterate through it with nested loops.

Here's the code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class TwoDimArrayVisualizer
{
    private const int rows = 10; // Number of rows in the grid
    private const int cols = 10; // Number of columns in the grid
    private const int squareSize = 20; // Size of each square in pixels
    
    private Color[,] colorGrid; // Two dimensional array holding colors

    public TwoDimArrayVisualizer()
    {
        // Initialize the two dimensional array
        colorGrid = new Color[rows, cols];
        Random rnd = new Random();

        // Populate the array with random colors
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++)
            {
                colorGrid[i, j] = Color.FromRgb(
                    (byte)rnd.Next(256), // Red value
                    (byte)rnd.Next(256), // Green value
                    (byte)rnd.Next(256)); // Blue value
            }
        }
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++)
            {
                // Create a rectangle geometry for each array element
                Rect rect = new Rect(j * squareSize, i * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize);

                // Create a brush with the color from the array
                SolidColorBrush brush = new SolidColorBrush(colorGrid[i, j]);

                // Draw the colored square on the canvas
                context.DrawRectangle(brush, null, rect);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This class, `TwoDimArrayVisualizer`, visualizes a two-dimensional array by assigning each element a color and drawing it as a square in a grid. The array `colorGrid` holds the colors, and we fill this with random colors in the constructor. The `Draw` method is then used to actually draw each square using a `DrawingContext`.

Newcomers can see this as an easy way to relate a two dimensional data structure with a visual representation. In a real application, the grid representation is often used in scenarios like creating game boards or pixel art tools.
