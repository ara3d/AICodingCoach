Generators in C# are not native the same way they are in languages like Python, but we can simulate their behavior using `IEnumerable<T>` combined with the `yield return` statement. Let's create a simple example that demonstrates this concept by drawing a series of rectangles whose sizes are determined by a generator function.

Please note that the actual implementation of `DrawingContext` for drawing graphics is provided by WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), which may not be as straightforward to newcomers as console applications. However, for the purpose of this example, I'll keep it as simple and clear as possible.

Here's a code example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

// A simple class that simulates a generator pattern using C# IEnumerable and yield return
public class RectanglesGenerator
{
    private readonly IEnumerable<Rect> _rectangles;

    // Constructor initializes the rectangle generator
    public RectanglesGenerator()
    {
        _rectangles = GenerateRectangles();
    }

    // Generator function that yields a series of rectangles
    private IEnumerable<Rect> GenerateRectangles()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            // Create a rectangle with diminishing sizes
            yield return new Rect(10 + i * 10, 10 + i * 10, 100 - i * 20, 100 - i * 20);
        }
    }

    // Draw function to draw the rectangles on a DrawingContext
    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        if (context == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(context));

        // Define the pen for drawing the rectangles' outline
        Pen pen = new Pen(Brushes.Black, 2);

        // Draw each rectangle
        foreach (Rect rect in _rectangles)
        {
            // Fill the rectangle with a semi-transparent brush
            context.DrawRectangle(new SolidColorBrush(Color.FromArgb(128, 255, 0, 0)), pen, rect);
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The class `RectanglesGenerator` contains an `IEnumerable<Rect>` that is initialized in its constructor, invoking the `GenerateRectangles` generator method.
- The `GenerateRectangles` method uses a loop to yield a series of rectangles, each smaller than the last.
- The `Draw` method goes through the generated rectangles and draws them using a `DrawingContext`, which is provided by the WPF framework.

Upon execution, you will see five nested rectangles, each with a different size, drawn onto the canvas. This example demonstrates how a generator can be used to create a sequence of elements on demand, in this case, a sequence of `Rect` objects that represent rectangles to be drawn.
