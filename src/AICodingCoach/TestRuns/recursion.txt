Certainly! Recursion is a coding technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. A classic visual example of recursion is the drawing of a fractal pattern. One simple fractal pattern we can create is a tree where each branch splits into two smaller branches.

In this C# example, we'll create a simple tree fractal using recursion. We'll define a class with the `Draw` method that uses recursion to draw each branch of the tree. The branches will become shorter and at a smaller angle from the previous branch as the recursion goes deeper.

Here's the C# class with a recursive `DrawBranch` method that will be called from the `Draw` method:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class RecursiveTreeDrawer
{
    public RecursiveTreeDrawer()
    {
        // Parameterless constructor
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        // Set the initial parameters for the tree
        Point rootPosition = new Point(400, 450); // Adjust for drawing surface size
        double length = 80;
        double angle = -90; // -90 degrees to point upwards

        // Start drawing the tree from the root
        DrawBranch(drawingContext, rootPosition, length, angle);
    }

    private void DrawBranch(DrawingContext drawingContext, Point position, double length, double angle)
    {
        if (length < 10) // Stop the recursion when branches are too small
            return;

        // Calculate the end point of the branch using trigonometry
        Point endPosition = new Point(
            position.X + length * Math.Cos(angle * Math.PI / 180),
            position.Y + length * Math.Sin(angle * Math.PI / 180));

        // Draw the line representing the current branch
        drawingContext.DrawLine(new Pen(Brushes.Brown, 1), position, endPosition);

        // Reduce the length for the next level of branches
        double shorterLength = length * 0.7;

        // Recursively draw the two smaller branches at a given angle
        DrawBranch(drawingContext, endPosition, shorterLength, angle + 30); // Right branch
        DrawBranch(drawingContext, endPosition, shorterLength, angle - 30); // Left branch
    }
}
```

When the `Draw` method is called by our graphics system, it begins by drawing the main trunk of the tree. Then, the `DrawBranch` method is recursively called for each smaller branch, bending them at 30-degree angles. This continues until the branches are too small to draw, which is our base case to stop the recursion.

Each `DrawBranch` call draws a smaller branch and is visually representative of the concept of recursion, where each branch is a smaller problem solved by the same method.
