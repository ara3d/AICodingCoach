The `while` statement in C# is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. The basic structure of a `while` loop is:

```csharp
while (condition)
{
    // Code to execute while the condition is true
}
```

Here, the `condition` is checked before each iteration, and if it evaluates to `true`, the code within the block is executed. If the `condition` becomes `false`, the loop terminates, and the flow of the program continues with the next statement after the loop.

To give you a practical example, let's write a fun and creative C# class to demonstrate how the `while` loop can be used to create a simple graphical pattern. Our `Draw` method will use `DrawingContext` to create a set of concentric circles where each subsequent circle is drawn while the radius is greater than zero.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class ConcentricCircles
{
    private double initialRadius;

    public ConcentricCircles()
    {
        initialRadius = 100; // Set initial radius for the largest circle
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Center of the circles
        Point center = new Point(150, 150);
        double radius = initialRadius;

        // Define the pen used to draw the circles
        Pen pen = new Pen(Brushes.DeepSkyBlue, 2);

        // Use a while loop to draw concentric circles
        while (radius > 0)
        {
            // Create a new circle geometry with the current radius
            EllipseGeometry circle = new EllipseGeometry(center, radius, radius);
            // Draw the circle using the DrawingContext
            context.DrawGeometry(null, pen, circle);

            // Decrement the radius for the next circle
            radius -= 10;
        }
    }
}
```

The `ConcentricCircles` class has a `Draw` method taking `DrawingContext` as an argument for rendering shapes. Inside the `Draw` method, we utilize a `while` loop to repeatedly draw circles with a decreasing radiusâ€”this creates the concentric circles effect. The loop continues to execute until `radius` is no longer greater than zero, at which point the loop exits.
