In C#, an "if" statement is a conditional statement that allows you to control the flow of your program based on whether a condition is true or false. The basic syntax of an if statement is:

```csharp
if (condition)
{
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

To demonstrate the concept using graphics, I will provide a class where the `Draw` function will create a simple visual representation. If a condition is met (for example, the x-coordinate is more than a certain value), the color of the shape will be green; otherwise, it will be red.

Here's an example C# class with the `Draw` method:

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class ConditionalDrawing
{
    // The Draw method, which shows how to use an if statement to change graphics
    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        // Define the color based on a condition
        Color shapeColor;
        int xPosition = 100;
        
        if (xPosition > 50)
        {
            // Condition is true, set color to green
            shapeColor = Colors.Green;
        }
        else
        {
            // Condition is false, set color to red
            shapeColor = Colors.Red;
        }

        // Create a SolidColorBrush with the chosen color
        SolidColorBrush brush = new SolidColorBrush(shapeColor);

        // Define the rectangle
        Rect rectangle = new Rect(new Point(50, 50), new Size(100, 100));

        // Draw the rectangle
        drawingContext.DrawRectangle(brush, null, rectangle);
    }
}
```

This class defines a `ConditionalDrawing` type that includes a `Draw` method. This method checks if `xPosition` is greater than 50 and sets the color of the rectangle accordingly before drawing it.

Remember to include the necessary directives to your project and a valid `System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext`, as this example assumes all relevant references have been made. The class doesn't have a constructor in this case because there's no need for initial setup or parameters when instantiating the object.
