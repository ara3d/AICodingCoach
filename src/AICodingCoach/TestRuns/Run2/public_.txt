In C#, `public` is an access modifier that specifies the declared scope of accessibility for classes, fields, methods, properties, and other members. When you declare a member of a class as public, you are allowing it to be accessed by any other code within the same assembly or another assembly that references it. This contrasts with other access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `internal`, which restrict access to different degrees.

Below is an interesting example of a C# class featuring graphics using WPF, which demonstrates the use of the `public` access modifier. The class `GraphicCircle` has a `public` `Draw` method which allows the `DrawingContext` object to draw a simple circle.

```csharp
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class GraphicCircle
{
    public GraphicCircle()
    {
        // Constructor with no parameters.
        // This is where you could initialize the object if needed.
    }

    // Draw method which works with System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext
    public void Draw(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        if (drawingContext == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException("drawingContext");

        var center = new Point(250, 250); // Center of the circle
        double radius = 100;               // Radius of the circle

        // Define the circle's outline (stroke) properties
        Pen pen = new Pen(Brushes.Black, 2);

        // Optional: Create a gradient brush to fill the circle with color
        RadialGradientBrush gradientBrush = new RadialGradientBrush();
        gradientBrush.GradientStops.Add(new GradientStop(Colors.CadetBlue, 0.0));
        gradientBrush.GradientStops.Add(new GradientStop(Colors.AliceBlue, 1.0));

        // Draw a circle
        drawingContext.DrawEllipse(gradientBrush, pen, center, radius, radius);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `GraphicCircle` class is designed to work within a WPF context, where a `DrawingContext` object is provided by the WPF rendering system. The `Draw` method is marked with `public`, which matches the requirement you described. When invoked, it draws a simple circle with a gradient fill, centered at (250, 250) with a radius of 100 units on a WPF canvas.
