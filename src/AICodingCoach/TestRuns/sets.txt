Certainly! Let's start with the concept of sets in C#. A set is a collection of distinct objects, where each object is unique within the set. In C#, you can represent a set using the `HashSet<T>` class, where `T` is the type of elements in the collection.

Here's an example class, `SetVisualizer`, that will draw two sets represented by colorful circles, and then demonstrate a union of those sets. A union includes all unique elements from both sets.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class SetVisualizer
{
    // No need for a parameter in the constructor for this example.
    public SetVisualizer()
    {
    }

    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Define two sets with some overlapping elements.
        var setA = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
        var setB = new HashSet<int> { 3, 4, 5, 6 };

        // Union of setA and setB
        var unionSet = new HashSet<int>(setA);
        unionSet.UnionWith(setB);
        
        // Offset to space out the circles in the drawing.
        const int offset = 30;
        
        // Draw set A
        DrawSet(context, setA, Brushes.Red, new Point(100, 100), offset);
        
        // Draw set B
        DrawSet(context, setB, Brushes.Blue, new Point(150, 100), offset);
        
        // Draw the Union of set A and B
        DrawSet(context, unionSet, Brushes.Purple, new Point(250, 100), offset);

        // Add legends to the drawings
        DrawLegend(context, "Set A", Brushes.Red, new Point(100, 200));
        DrawLegend(context, "Set B", Brushes.Blue, new Point(150, 200));
        DrawLegend(context, "Union of A and B", Brushes.Purple, new Point(250, 200));
    }

    private void DrawSet(DrawingContext context, HashSet<int> set, Brush brush, Point start, int offset)
    {
        foreach (int item in set)
        {
            // Drawing a circle for each element in the set.
            context.DrawEllipse(brush, null, new Point(start.X + item * offset, start.Y), 10, 10);
        }
    }

    private void DrawLegend(DrawingContext context, string text, Brush brush, Point position)
    {
        // Drawing the legend text.
        FormattedText formattedText = new FormattedText(
            text,
            System.Globalization.CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
            FlowDirection.LeftToRight,
            new Typeface("Verdana"),
            12,
            Brushes.Black
        );

        // Draw legend color square
        context.DrawRectangle(brush, null, new Rect(position.X, position.Y + 5, 10, 10));
        
        // Draw the legend text
        context.DrawText(formattedText, new Point(position.X + 15, position.Y));
    }
}
```

In this code:

- `HashSet<int>` is used to represent sets of numbers.
- `DrawSet()` function draws circles for each element in the set, with distinct colors to differentiate between sets.
- `DrawLegend()` function adds a small square and text next to each set representation to label it.
- The union of the two sets is created with `UnionWith()` and then displayed with purple circles.

Each set is visualized as a series of circles, where each circle corresponds to an element in the set. The overlap between the red (Set A) and blue (Set B) is shown as purple circles representing the union of the sets.
