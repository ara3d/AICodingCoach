Certainly! Let's create a C# class that demonstrates the concept of classes using a visual example. In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is like a blueprint for creating objects. We will create a simple "House" class to visually represent this idea, and then we'll draw a couple of houses on a canvas to show creating instances of that class.

Here's a basic `House` class:

```csharp
using System.Windows.Media;
using System.Windows;

public class House
{
    // Fields to represent properties of a House.
    private double _x;
    private double _y;
    private double _width;
    private double _height;
    private Color _color;

    // Parameterless constructor to set default values.
    public House()
    {
        // Default properties for the house
        _x = 100;
        _y = 100;
        _width = 100;
        _height = 100;
        _color = Colors.Blue;
    }

    // Draw method to represent the house graphically.
    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Create the Brush and Pen to draw the house.
        Brush houseBrush = new SolidColorBrush(_color);
        Pen housePen = new Pen(Brushes.Black, 3);

        // Draw the base of the house
        Rect baseRect = new Rect(_x, _y, _width, _height);
        context.DrawRectangle(houseBrush, housePen, baseRect);

        // Draw the roof
        Point roofPeak = new Point(_x + _width / 2, _y - _height / 2);
        Point baseLeft = new Point(_x, _y);
        Point baseRight = new Point(_x + _width, _y);
        context.DrawLine(housePen, baseLeft, roofPeak);
        context.DrawLine(housePen, baseRight, roofPeak);
    }
}

public class MyDrawing
{
    // The Draw method is called to draw on the canvas.
    // A DrawingContext is provided which allows drawing shapes, text, images, etc.
    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Instantiate and draw the first House
        House house1 = new House();
        house1.Draw(context);

        // Create second house with some different properties just for fun
        // Note: this would normally require additional methods or a constructor with parameters
        House house2 = new House();
        // We would need to set properties like position and color, but we can't
        // because they are private and there's no method to change them in House class.
        // Ideally, we should add public methods or a constructor in House to allow this.
        house2.Draw(context);
    }
}
```

This code introduces a newcomer to several key concepts:

- **Classes and Objects**: `House` is a class, and we create its instances (`house1` and `house2`) using the `new` keyword.
- **Methods**: The `House` class has a `Draw` method that is responsible for rendering the house.
- **Encapsulation**: We made fields private to show that it's a common practice to encapsulate class data.
- **Drawing API**: We've used `DrawingContext` to draw shapes representing the house.

Admittedly, to make `house2` look different from `house1`, we would need to introduce more OOP concepts such as properties or constructors with parameters, but as per your instructions, we have kept the `House` class simple with a parameterless constructor.

This example provides a visual way to grasp how multiple objects (houses in this case) can be created from the same class blueprint, even though in the current example they look the same due to fixed properties.
