In this example, we'll create a simple C# class with a `Draw` method that takes a `DrawingContext` object and uses it to draw a visualization of a polar function. Polar functions define a set of points in the plane with polar coordinates, where each point is determined by an angle and a distance from the origin.

Let's create a rose-like pattern, which is a well-known polar function defined by `r(θ) = A * cos(k * θ)` where `A` is amplitude, `k` is the number of petals if `k` is even (or doubles the number of petals if `k` is odd), and `θ` is the angle in radians.

Here is the class with a visualization of such a polar function:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Media;

public class PolarFunctionDrawer
{
    // Parameterless constructor
    public PolarFunctionDrawer() {}

    // Draw method: renders the polar function graphic.
    public void Draw(DrawingContext context)
    {
        // Constants to define the properties of the polar function
        double amplitude = 100;  // A in the equation r(θ) = A * cos(k * θ)
        int k = 5;               // k in the equation, determining the number of petals
        double scale = 1;        // A scaling factor to adjust the overall size
        
        // Set up the pen for drawing
        Pen pen = new Pen(Brushes.DeepSkyBlue, 2);

        // Draw the polar function in a 360-degree loop
        for (double theta = 0; theta <= 2 * Math.PI; theta += 0.01)
        {
            // Calculate the radius for the current angle
            double radius = amplitude * Math.Cos(k * theta) * scale;

            // Convert polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates for drawing
            double x = radius * Math.Cos(theta);
            double y = radius * Math.Sin(theta);

            // Offset the center to the middle of our drawing area
            Point center = new Point(250, 250);
            x += center.X;
            y += center.Y;

            // We draw tiny lines between sequential points to create the perception of a curve
            if (theta > 0) // Skip the very first point, so we don't draw a line from the origin
            {
                double prevRadius = amplitude * Math.Cos(k * (theta - 0.01)) * scale;
                double prevX = prevRadius * Math.Cos(theta - 0.01) + center.X;
                double prevY = prevRadius * Math.Sin(theta - 0.01) + center.Y;

                context.DrawLine(pen, new Point(prevX, prevY), new Point(x, y));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation of the code:
- The class `PolarFunctionDrawer` contains a method `Draw` that is called to produce the graphic.
- The polar function is `r(θ) = A * cos(k * θ)` where `A` is the amplitude of the oscillation in the function, and `k` determines the number of petals in our rose-like diagram.
- In the `Draw` method, we loop from `θ = 0` to `θ = 2 * π`, representing a full circle in radians. For each angle, we calculate the corresponding radius from our polar function.
- We convert the polar coordinates `(radius, theta)` into Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`, which are then adjusted by a center point to center the drawing on our canvas.
- We draw a series of small lines between consecutive points to form the appearance of a continuous curve.

The resulting output will be a rose-like pattern centered on the drawing area, depicted in a DeepSkyBlue color.
